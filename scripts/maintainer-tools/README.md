# Maintainer Tools

This folder contains several tools designed to help with the maintenance of the
project.

- **Copyright headers:** The [`copyright-headers`](https://storage.bsc.es/gitlab/hpc/gekkofs/-/tree/master/scripts/maintainer-tools/copyright-headers) folder contains a
script to add/remove copyright headers from source files in the project.
The script relies on a Docker container that encapsulates a patched version of
[osterman/copyright-header](https://github.com/osterman/copyright-header).
